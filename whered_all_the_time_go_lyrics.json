{"lyrics": "Where'd all the time go?\r\nIt's starting to fly.\r\nSee how the hands go;\r\nWaving goodbye.\r\nAnd you know I get so forgetful\n\nwhen I look in your eyes.\n\n\n\nNow she's walking backwards\n\nthrough a parade.\n\nAnd I'm stuck in the shadow\n\nblocking the shade.\n\n\n\nAnd there ain't no way to sweep up the mess that we've made\n\nShe gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed\n\n\n\nFlowers for the sick and dead\n\nShe's on the go, way too fast and way too slow\n\nShe'll turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes\n\nand when the fog rises somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore\n\n\n\nThere's nothing to keep you\n\nfrom falling in love.\n\nIt starts at the bottom\n\nand comes from above.\n\n\n\nLike pieces of a puzzle, like a hand in a glove\n\nShe gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed\n\n\n\nFlowers for the sick and dead\n\nShe's on the go, way too fast and way too slow\n\nShe'll turn and stop at hospitals and funeral homes\n\nand when the tide rises somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye"}
