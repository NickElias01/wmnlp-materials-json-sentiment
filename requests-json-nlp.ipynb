    "The polarities do not match up with my expectations. \"Creep\" by Radiohead is a very melancholic song, where the chorus says \"I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo...\", yet it scored higher than any other song, even higher than the song \"Happy\" which is ridiculous. After looking at the lyrics, the phrase \"I wish I was special\" and the word \"special\" were repeated throughout, so that may have been a reason why it scored high. /m Also, \"Shake it Off\" by Taylor Swift scored very low compared to the rest, at -0.47. There may have been some sarcasm throughout the songs that may have confused the Spacy pipeline, so it would be interesting to further research this."
